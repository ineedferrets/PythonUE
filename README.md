# Python UE: Phoebs' Repository for Exploring Python Integration in Unreal Engine
This project is made as a test environment for me to play around with using Python in Unreal Engine. It is originally filled with materials from Tuatara-VFX's tutorial on Getting Started with Python UE, found here: [https://tuataragames.notion.site/Setting-up-Unreal-Engine-9fbe11f877914435ba1d24f4f1c90c98https://github.com/Tuatara-VFX/getting-started-python-ue?tab=readme-ov-file](https://tuataragames.notion.site/Getting-started-with-Python-in-Unreal-Engine-5191d0a16b424d66b08b132d5764cefd)

The aim is to just mess around, learn how it works, and maybe make some fun things as well. This isn't going to be a very clean or tidy repo. If I come up with some fun ideas for things, I will try and put them in their own repo or plugin for UE.
